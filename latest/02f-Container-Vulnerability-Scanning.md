## Container Vulnerability Scanning
As containers become an almost ubiquitous method of packaging and deploying applications, the instances of malware have increased. Securing containers is now a top priority for DevOps engineers. Fortunately, a number of open-source programs are available that scan containers and container images. Let's look at five such tools.

### What can Container Security Scanning do?
- Detect insecure containers
    + Detect outdated libraries
    + Detect incorrectly configured containers
    + Detect outdated operating systems
- Detect compliance violations
- Suggest best practices

### Issues with Container Security Scanner
- Level of depth depends on the tool being used, so the results that you'll get are very dependent on the type of tool you choose.
- Easy to go "too far" with configuration; there are tools where you can configure so many different settings that it's easy to go overboard.
- Will the scan results lead to actionable events?

### Where and When to use Container Scanner?

You can use it at the build phase when you're actually building, for instance, a Dockerfile and looking at the resulting image that you're creating. Another location to perform container scanning would be when you push a container to the registry or when you pull a container from a registry. However, a good approach is scanning before pushing into a trusted container registry; then, you can say we have a container registry with a scanned version of all images, and for deploying in production, you can pull from this trusted container registry.
